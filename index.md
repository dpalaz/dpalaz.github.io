## Researcher in Speech Technology

I am a research scientist with 14 years of experience in speech technologies, deep neural networks and representation learning. My research is focused on detecting patterns in speech, including phoneme recognition, continuous speech recognition and voice activity detection. I've also worked on paralinguistic detection tasks, specifically speech emotion recognition and non-verbal vocalisation detection, focusing on the generalisation capability of such models. Lately I'm interested in self-supervision and acoustic-to-articulatory inversion.

I am Principal Research Scientist and Tech Lead at Speech Graphics since 2017. In my research, I work with deep learning models to improve audio-driven facial animation. My role also implies strategic planning, project management, MLOps, product management, software development (C++) and infrastructure.

I obtained a Ph.D. from EPFL in Switzerland in 2016, where I worked on applying deep learning methods to speech recognition, focusing on using the raw speech signal as input. My doctoral studies were done at Idiap Research Institute under the supervision of Ronan Collobert, Mathew Magimai Doss and Hervé Bourlard.
